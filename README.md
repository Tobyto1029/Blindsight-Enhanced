# Blindsight Enhanced

A RimWorld mod to fix my personally favorite thematic meme, Blindsight

Tons of credit go out to both of the mods that do very similar things in different ways,
[SpiritSight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2554648023) and [TrueSight - Blindsight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2555271662). Check them out, both go in a different way of improving Blindsight.

<br/>

## This is my first RimWorld Mod
If there is any suggestions and bugs, please let me know!

<br/>

## Features
- Psysight: As pawns gain Psylink levels, they proportionally increase their sight, starting at
25% sight with no Psylink or Level 1 Psylink all the way up to 150% at Level 6 Psylink
- Even though the pawns can "see" they are still considered to be blind

## Planned
- Removing certain variables affecting *normal* sight; Light shouldn't affect workspeed with psysight, should it?
